# Laravel JMeter Examples

These are simple examples of using JMeter for a Laravel application.

This is a simple Laravel install with Breeze and some contrived examples. It does not contain any extra unit tests or code standards. It is only for reference / proof of concept stuff.

These may not be the best versions of JMeter - and when I do a project, I do much more targeted stuff using XPath, time, etc. This is just to get someone started.

## Get Started

* check this out into a directory and make sure it can be served
* run the standard laravel setup like migrate and compile any npm assets (and seed data)
* surf to the url
* optionally install JMeter

## Functionality

## Search and Confirm Results

* Visit `/dogs`
* Search a dog. Note no results for 'barf' - but multiple results for 'collie'

## Authenticate / Login
